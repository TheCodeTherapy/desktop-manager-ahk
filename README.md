## Setup:
- First, press Win key + Tab and make sure you already have your desired number of virtual desktops created (I use 4). You can create new ones by pressing the square with the + sign (New Desktop);
- Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/);
- Run the desktop.ahk script provided on the repository.

You're ready to go ðŸ˜Š

## Default config:

The current default configuration of the script counts with:
- `WinKey + 1` ~to~ `WinKey + 4`: Switches between each respective virtual desktop (assuming you have 4 like me);
- `Mouse on Top Left corner` of your screen: Triggers WinKey + Tab (so you can view all your open windows and bring the one you want to focus);

The script is pretty simple, and you can write your own behavior set for the hot corners (basically you can use hot corners to perform any task that AutoHotKey is capable of doing. Be creative and do something that may be useful for you ðŸ¤“) 

If you found a useful purpose for the hot corners or made improvements to this script, please let me know on Twitter [@marcogomez_](https://twitter.com/marcogomez_)

**Please keep in mind that I'm not experienced with AutoHotKey or Windows**, that was just a desperate attempt to addapt to a Windows environment (which is something new for me as I used Linux throughout my entire life).
